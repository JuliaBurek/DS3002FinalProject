# DS3002FinalProject

  In this project, I wrote and deployed a process that executes exactly once every minute, retrieving data from a remote API and wrote all retrieved values to a database for 60 minutes. After my data was deployed to the database, I observed some patterns and changes in the data over time. This analysis can be found in my Data Analysis file. 

  For this project, I created an RDS instance in AWS. I connected this RDS instance to MySQL workbench. In a terminal on VScode, I created a virtual environment and installed Chalice. I created a new project called DSproject. I made sure all of the necessary packages were installed and listed in requirements.txt. In the app.py file, I wrote the necessary code to retrieve data from the remote API and write to a database, which was the 'project' table that I created in phpMyAdmin using my host, username, and password from my RDS instance. In order to retrieve the data once every minute for an hour, I utilized a Lambda function that used a cron expression so that the data would pull once every minute for an hour. I let the data load for an hour and was able to retrieve my data in my 'project' table in phpMyAdmin using my host, username, and password from my RDS instance. After all of the necessary data was loaded into the table, I began to make observations about it.
